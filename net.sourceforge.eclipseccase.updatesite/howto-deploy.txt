HowTo Deploy Release and Updatesite
===================================

Requires: Eclipse 3.0 and all projects and features in workspace.

Note: Build has to be done manually because we should test after build if
      it is usable and everything works.

1. ensure same version number for all features and plugins
   (check feature.xml files)

2. update version numbers in site.xml

3. build each feature as single, deployable zip into 
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/full/${feature_id}_${feature_version}.zip"
   (either via File->Export...->Deployable Feature or via feature.xml->Export...)
   
4. build update site
   (right click site.xml->PDE Tools->Build Site)
   
5. check directories for content:
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/full/" 
     -> one zip with features and plugins for each feature
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/features/" 
     -> one feature jar for each feature
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/plugins/" 
     -> one plugin jar for each plugin
     
6. break: test the build output and update site from within your local 
   machin if it works, only upload/deploy a release that works.

7. create "login.properties" with user=... and password=... next to site-deploy.xml

8. run site-deploy.xml with ant
   (right click "Run Ant..." with target "all")
