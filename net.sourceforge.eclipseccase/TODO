
1)	Refactoring ops should perform ccase ops when files need to be modified.
2)	implement moveProject, delete* in ModifricationHandler - neccessary?
3)	Add UI
		a)	prompt for comment on checkin/checkout/etc, along with prefs to
			turn on/off prompt
		b)	UI for find checkouts, checkin all
		c)	more of the UI needed to do everything clearcase inside of
			eclipse (create view, etc)
4)	Refactor code to cache state - like how example proiders do it.
5)	Add static view support
6)	Add cleartool usage for cross platform usage - Best way to do this might
	be to run a single instance of cleartool and send commands/parse results
