The plugin is pretty simple right now, but works for me under Windows
NT sp6a with clearcase version 4.2 and eclipse version >= F3 (Due to API
changes, older versions of eclipse need older versions of the plugin)
If you get the plugin working with a different configuration, feel
free to post your setup to the sourceforge forums for this project

I only use dynamic views, so I have only really tested it
with them.  I have added some basic snapshot view functionality
(such as update), but no guarantees as to how well it works.
The way I use it is to create my project directory in a
clearcase view, and _then_ create a new eclipse project,
pointing it to that directory in the view.  Once I have an
eclipse project that uses a clearcase directory as its project
directory, I can then associate that project with my plugin by
selecting the project in the resource tree view, right click,
then Team->Associate with clearcase. After this, clearcase
operations are then active for all resources in the project.

There is currently no way to add an existing eclipse project to
clearcase version control - though once you have a
Project dir under clearcase, you can add a subtree of
files to clearcase, so only requirement is the initial
project directory under clearcase.

You can do some basic configuration via the eclipse preferences
dialog, under the Team->Clearcase entry.
