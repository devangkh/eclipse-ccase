0.9.6
-----

- Fixed ModificationHandler to ignore duplicate files (prevents the file already checked
  out dialog sometimes seen during refactoring)
- Prevent plugin activation when clearcase engine fails to initialize
- Synchronized access to JNI layer in simple api (hopefully prevents jvm crashes)
- Added option to control preservig of modification time on checkin

0.9.5
-----

- Converted to use net.sourceforge.clearcase library instead of JNI - this should
  fix the random JVM crashes people were having
- 0.9.4 release did not include ccjni.dll - fixed as it is no longer used in 0.9.5


0.9.4
-----

- Added double click for open in Checkouts view
- Checkouts view now uses the results of a clearcase find checkouts to refresh itself
- Added "Compare With->Predecessor" in standard resource popups - this opens builtin eclipse
  compare tool
- Now performs a quick update on resource change so that changes discovered by the auto
  refresh plugin show up in workspace (i.e if you chcout a file manually using native
  clearcase tools)
- Added a property page (right click->properties on a resource)

0.9.3
-----

- Added support for linked resources
- Removed constraint that project needs to be a clearcase element
- Changed build system to use PDE build and package structure

0.9.2
-----

- Fixed performance bottleneck when loading state cache at startup
- Switched decorator mechanism to new lightweight decorators.  This version will only work with recent versions (12/15/2002) of the eclipse 2.1 development stream
- Fixed a bug with refactoring
- Fixed a bug with refreshing state on uncheckout
- When doing a multi item action, sort resources with directories last so that modification of a directory does not abort modification of files within it.
- Added a view for keeping track of all checked out files (Window->Show View->Other...->Team->Clearcase Checkouts)
- Added quick refresh (Contributed by Winfried Stenzel)

0.9.1
-----

- Rebuilt with JDK 1.3 to fix binary incompatibility

0.9.0
-----

- Added background update of clearcase state
- Restructured preferences dialog - you'll need to reconfigure
- Fixed decorator caching of images so it no longer exhausts the UI resources and crashes eclipse
- Added some more graphical decorations
- Added more control over text decorations
- Switched from using Natures to persistent properties to associate a project with clearcase.  You'll need to reassociate your projects
- Cleaned up JNI layer to prevent crashes and to work with VC7.NET
- Fixed other bugs


0.8.1
-----

- ???
